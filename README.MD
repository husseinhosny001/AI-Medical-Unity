# AI-Medical-Unity  
Bridging Artificial Intelligence with Finite Element Simulation for Next-Generation Medical Analysis

---

## 🔬 Vision & Mission
AI-Medical-Unity is an open scientific-engineering framework designed to unify:

✔ Artificial Intelligence  
✔ Finite Element Simulation (FEM)  
✔ Medical imaging & clinical data  
✔ Research-grade reproducibility  

…into a **single modular ecosystem** that empowers researchers, clinicians, and developers to build advanced medical-AI pipelines with strong scientific grounding.

The project is built as a **research-first, innovation-oriented platform** with the goal of enabling:
- Smart diagnostic modeling
- Patient-specific biomechanical simulation
- Data-driven medical prediction
- Transparent and reproducible AI research
